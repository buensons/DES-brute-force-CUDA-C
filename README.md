# DES-brute-force-CUDA-C

This program cracks DES (Data Encryption Standard) using brute force algorithm both on CPU and GPU.

Proper DES have 64 bit key, but it takes forever for the CPU to compute it, so there is option to compare running times using smaller keys.

My DES implementation is based on this paper: https://billstclair.com/grabbe/des.htm
